assert(wp.summary == 'rc-Reviewer has signed off 11/29...')
assert(wp.maintext == u'S.J. Rozan is a good old-fashioned mystery writer, and I mean that as a high compliment. Like Agatha Christie, Rozan doesn\u2019t flinch from murder, but she\u2019d rather not show you the gory struggles that resulted in the corpse. Ditto for sex: Rozan\u2019s youthful private eyes, Lydia Chin and Bill Smith, are no prudes, but they have too much work on their minds to take snogging breaks.\nLydia grew up in New York\u2019s Chinatown. She knows all the best hole-in-the-wall noodle joints, and Chinatown knows her well, too. That sense of a watchful, tightly bound community is the aspect of the terrific Lydia Chin/Bill Smith series that most happily distinguishes it as \u201cold-fashioned.\u201d\nIn \u201cGhost Hero,\u201d the 11th novel in the series, Rozan takes readers on a colorful insider tour of the contemporary Chinese art scene. Our intrepid detectives race off to galleries in Chelsea and studios in the outer-borough Chinatown satellite of Flushing, Queens. They bone up on textiles, paper cutting and pen-and-ink drawing. This cram course in Art Appreciation 101 is necessitated by a curious case that Lydia takes against her better judgment. A shifty white guy who says he\u2019s an art collector hires her to investigate the rumors that new works have surfaced by a famous Chinese artist, Chau Chun. Chau\u2019s art is renowned for combining traditional images (jumping carp, craggy mountain paths) with poetry that can be read as politically incendiary. If there were new Chau paintings to be had, they would be snapped up by eager collectors like Lydia\u2019s new client \u2014 especially given the fact that Chau was killed in the Tiananmen Square uprising in 1989. Ever after, he has been known as \u201cGhost Hero Chau.\u201d\n\u201cGhost Hero\u201d is haunted by the tragedies and courageous legacy of China\u2019s failed democracy movement. As Lydia and Bill get caught up in the swirl of rumors about Chau\u2019s paintings, Rozan raises philosophical issues about the power of art to agitate and inspire, and about the morality of secluding that art on the walls of wealthy collectors.\nAs always in the Lydia Chin/Bill Smith mysteries, there\u2019s also the tension of unresolved longing. (Lydia and Bill have been locked in a chaste \u201cTwilight\u201d-like tango for so long, they make Bella and Edward look weak-willed.) In \u201cGhost Hero,\u201d that romantic plot is complicated by the arrival of a Chinese American private eye, a hunk named Jack Lee. Although Lydia\u2019s mother clearly prefers this new prospect to \u201cthe white baboon,\u201d as she calls Bill, she has misgivings about Jack\u2019s credentials. Midway through the novel, she grills Lydia about the new guy:\n\u201cAnd he is Chinese?\u201d Lydia says her mother is \u201cjust checking. Because he might be Japanese, or Korean. From a different planet, in her universe, but still light-years ahead of Bill.\u201d\n\u201cJack Lee Yat-sen,\u201d Lydia confirms. \u201cFrom Wisconsin. He\u2019s second generation, parents born here, too.\u201d\n\u201cChinese, is he?\u201d her mother sniffs. \u201cHollow bamboo.\u201d Lydia translates for us: \u201cChinese-looking outside, empty inside.\u201d\nLong before \u201cTiger Mother\u201d became an all-too-familiar moniker, there was Lydia\u2019s mom, roaring away at her detective daughter, who, respectfully, roars right back. Indeed, the only flaw in this lively and enlightening suspense tale is that Lydia\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t have more than a few walk-on, stalk-on lines.\n \nCorrigan, who teaches literature at Georgetown University, is the book critic for the NPR program \u201cFresh Air.\u201d\nghost hero\nBy S.

assert(cnbc.summary == 'Congress waited for President Barack Obama to return from Hawaii and make one final attempt to avoid the "fiscal cliff."')
assert(cnbc.maintext == u'  The United States on Wednesday edged closer to the "fiscal cliff" as Congress waited for President Barack Obama to return from vacation in Hawaii and make one final attempt to avoid huge tax hikes and spending cuts in the New Year. \n  In the absence of Obama, there was no sign of either side in Congress making an effort to strike a deal. The corridors of the Capitol building were empty except for an occasional police officer, and members\' office doors stayed locked. \n  House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner has not yet set a date for bringing House members back to Washington from their Christmas break, an aide of the Republican leader said. That makes the timing of a vote on any budget deal before Dec. 31 more difficult. \n  The Boehner aide also said there were no plans for new talks between the top Republican in Congress and Obama, who flies overnight and is due back in the White House on Thursday morning. \n  The inaction notwithstanding, there was still just enough time to prevent a fiscal crunch that would upset global financial markets and likely push the United States into recession. \n  Reports of lackluster retail holiday sales added to the urgency for a deal. Shoppers might be spending less this holiday season in fear of looming income tax increases. U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday, dragged lower by shares of retail companies. \n (Read More: \'Geithner Warns: US Hits Debt Ceiling Monday\') \n  A modest, last-minute measure in Congress to avoid deep spending cuts set for Jan. 1 and most of the tax hikes could pass the Democratic-controlled Senate by the New Year, although Republicans would need to agree not use a procedural roadblock known as a filibuster. \n  But senators probably would not make the effort unless there was a strong signal from Boehner that the House would find a way to go along. \n  A Senate Democratic aide downplayed chances for votes this week in the Senate, but suggested there could be legislative movement over the weekend. \n  "We can\'t do anything until Republicans either give us the 60 votes," which are needed to advance legislation without long procedural delays, or allow a short-cut that lets bills pass on a simple majority vote in the 100-member chamber. \n  The focus in Congress is shifting from broad deficit reduction to narrower efforts to avert the immediate shock of the Dec. 31 cliff dive. \n  "This is the (emergency) scenario that we have long believed would rise in probability the closer we go to Dec. 31, which essentially calls for extending all the rates for those individuals making under $200K and households under $250K and does not address the debt ceiling or the deficit," analyst Chris Krueger of Guggenheim Securities wrote in a research note. \n  Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, who is retiring at year\'s end, told MSNBC that $250,000 "is too low of a threshold" for raising income taxes. \n  She said that in conversations she has had with some Senate Democrats, "they are saying maybe more in the $400,000 to $500,000 category." \n  Obama himself recently offered to raise the threshold to $400,000, before negotiations with Boehner broke off. \n Tick-Tock \n  But even if a handful of Senate Republicans support Democrats on a measure to avoid the worst of the fiscal cliff, time is short. \n  When the Senate returns Thursday it is due to work on a disaster aid bill to help New York and New Jersey recover from Super Storm Sandy and other measures. \n  In the Republican-controlled House, any bill that raises taxes on anyone would need a rare bipartisan vote to win approval. \n  All 191 Democrats might have to team up with at least 26 Republicans to get a majority if the bill included tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans, as Obama is demanding. \n  (Read More: What Issues Obama May Tackle in Second Term) \n  Some of those votes could conceivably come from among the 34 Republican members who are either retiring or were defeated in the November elections and no longer have to worry about the political fallout. \n  An alternative is for Congress to let income taxes go up on everyone as scheduled. Then, during the first week of January, lawmakers would strike a quick deal to reduce them except on people in the highest brackets. \n  They would also pass a measure putting off the $109 billion in automatic spending cuts that most lawmakers want to avoid. \n  Once the clock ticks past midnight on Dec. 31, no member of Congress would have to vote for a tax increase on anyone \u2014 taxes would have risen automatically \u2014 and the only votes would be to decrease tax rates for most Americans back to their 2012 levels. \n  Americans\' optimism that Obama and congressional leaders will reach a budget agreement before Jan. 1 has waned in recent days, according to a Gallup poll. \n  Fifty percent believe a deal will be reached, a drop of 7 percentage points from the previous week, and 48 percent are doubtful. The poll was taken just after talks ran into trouble last week. \n   Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz is urging workers in the company\'s roughly 120 Washington-area coffee shops to write "come together" on customers\' cups on Thursday and Friday to send a message to politicians. \n  "We\'re paying attention, we\'re greatly disappointed in what\'s going on and we deserve better," Schultz said.

assert(guardian.summary == u'Politics, history and money all affect TV scheduling, but the BBC\u2019s decision to run its adaptation of Iain Banks\u2019s novel in two hour-long episodes doesn\u2019t add up')
assert(guardian.maintext == u'There are many reasons to welcome the presence in the schedules of Stonemouth, which concludes tonight at 9pm on BBC2. It stands as a broadcasting memorial stone to Iain Banks, the author of the source novel, and there are sparky performances from a cast including Peter Mullan and Charlotte Spencer.\n In one sense, though, the drama is easily overlooked, since tonight\u2019s final episode comes only seven days after the first. The commissioning plans for any TV network resemble a maths exercise book, with recurrent sums such as 8 x 60, 6 x 60 and so on, where the first figure denotes the number of episodes and the second the length of the slots. The one that adds up to 480 minutes (minus trailers and ads) is currently the most popular shape in UK drama, used by two of the standout television fictions of this year: Poldark (BBC1) and Humans (continuing on Sundays, Channel 4, 9pm).\n Stonemouth, however, came up with an unusual answer to the question of how best to tell its story \u2013 120, or 2 x 60. Although it qualifies as a mini-series under Bafta rules, it is an unusually mini one. Of this year\u2019s four nominees in the mini-series category, three were 3 x 60s and one (the winner, The Lost Honour of Christopher Jeffries) a 2 x 90. The (not always easily distinguishable) drama series section chose from three 6 x 60s (among them the winner, Happy Valley) and one 8 x 60.\n The first number in the sum \u2013 the quantity of episodes \u2013 has recently taken on a political dimension. While the Conservative government has indicated that the BBC will face cuts in its licence fee and activities, the broadcaster is being encouraged to extend in one direction. When I interviewed him during the election, George Osborne expressed concern that British broadcasters (including Channel 4 and ITV) failed to produce their hits \u2013 such as Poldark and Downton Abbey \u2013 in sufficient bulk to maximise their artistic and commercial impact. An American network hit \u2013 such as The Good Wife \u2013 does annual runs of 22 episodes, while even shows produced by cable or streamed networks \u2013 Breaking Bad, House of Cards \u2013 come in seasons of 13.\n Although the chancellor was correct to suggest that Downton Abbey and Call the Midwife would be two or three times longer if made in America \u2013 and he will be pleased that Channel 4\u2019s Indian Summers runs in multiples of 10 \u2013 two industrial conditions in British television militate against this ambition. Almost all major UK dramas are written by a single writer or writing team, whereas the US distributes episodes between large teams of screenwriters. At the moment, Sally Wainwright is working on six more instalments of Happy Valley and Debbie Horsfield another eight of Poldark (based on Winston Graham\u2019s novels) . In order to produce 22 instalments, the creators would have to become insomniac, celibate hermits or surrender the auteur tradition. However, the individual voice has been such a key element of British TV drama historically that there would need to be a debate \u2013 and possibly even a referendum \u2013 before it were abandoned.\n A strong argument for the anti camp would be that spreading opportunity and risk by producing a larger number of shorter series is another part of the British tradition. This is the case, particularly and not unreasonably, at the BBC, which has statutory obligations to reflect and serve various parts and people of the UK. The newspaper headlines \u2013 and questions from parliamentary select committees \u2013 if the BBC were to commit to 22 parts of a story that turned out to be a flop or a controversy are easy to imagine.\n The second figure in these dramatic equations \u2013 the screen minutes allocated to each instalment \u2013 is more of an artistic rather than a commercial judgement, although it is influenced by the relatively rigid grid system of British network television, which features more or less immovable slots for news bulletins.\n This winter marks the 15th anniversary of the final episode of Inspector Morse, but the show\u2019s influence on televisual arithmetic remains strong. Revolutionary when the series started in 1987, the use of a two-hour pseudo-movie length for a detective story was widely copied and still survives, unlike most of the characters, in Midsomer Murders.\n The obvious logic for having one murder investigation per episode is that it is hard for an audience to retain clues and suspects in their brains for a week between episodes. One reason for the increasing popularity of the conspiracy or espionage thriller \u2013 Line of Duty, The Honourable Woman, The Game \u2013 is that stories with frequent twists and new plot lines or flashbacks neatly fit the structure of half a dozen or so hour-long episodes.\n Stonemouth, though, is neither one thing (The Lost Honour of Christopher Jeffries) nor the other (Happy Valley). To feel satisfyingly substantial and do justice to the narrative, it surely needed to be either 3 x 60 or a festival or bank holiday special at 1 x 90 or 1 x 120. The solution they arrived at \u2013 2 x 60 \u2013 doesn\u2019t add up.')
