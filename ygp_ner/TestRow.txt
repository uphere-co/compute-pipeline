<b>Ionizing Radiation</b>
EPA regulates airborne emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) (including radionuclides) from a specific list of industrial sources called \
―source categories.‖ Each source category that emits radionuclides in significant quantities must meet technology requirements to control them a\
nd is required to meet specific regulatory limits. These standards are the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Radionuc\
lides (Rad NESHAPs) and are found at 40 CFR Part 61  Specific NESHAPs applicable to radiation are:
(1) Subpart B applicable to radon-222 emissions to the ambient air from underground uranium mines
(2) Subpart H applicable to radionuclide emissions, other than radon, from Department of Energy facilities
(3) Subpart I applicable to radionuclide emissions emitted by federal facilities that are not regulated elsewhere
(4) Subpart K applicable to emissions of polonium-210 and lead-210 to the air from phosphorus plants
(5) Subpart Q applicable to emissions of radon-222 to the ambient air from Department of Energy storage or disposal facilities for radium-contai\
ning materials
(6) Subpart R applicable to emissions of radon from phosphogypsum stacks
(7) Subpart T applicable to radon-222 emissions from uranium mill tailings piles that are no longer operational
(8) Subpart W applicable to emission of radon-222 from uranium mills and their associated tailings.
